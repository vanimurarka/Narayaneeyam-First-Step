					How can I explain the immense happiness I have now when I stumbled upon your wonderful site http://narayaneeyam-firststep.org/index.html.
					Today morning I was just thinking as to how to keep Narayaneeyam Parayanam for Dec 13 2009 on the Narayaneeyam day. While I have the gist of 
					meaning of every Narayaneeyam slokam already,  I was thinking how would it be if word-by-word translation is given on the web. <br><br>
					All these years
					I have browsed several days over the subject and such a thing never was available. Now when I came across your site it was like Lord 
					Guruvayurappan answering my thoughts. Hantha Bhaagyam Janaanaam! Thank you so much for your wonderful work and I eagerly look forward for 
					your uploading further Dasakams.

					My humble prostrations at the lotus feet of Lord Guruvayoorappan and sincere thanks to you for bringing out this site.
					I have just started ‘learning’ to read the great epic ‘Shriman Narayaneeyam’ as a group study along with a few like-minded friends.
					I have read the whole of Narayaneeyam  about 3 or 4 times on my own (once with English synopsis of each verse), but have not been satisfied.
					<br><br>
					This sparked an urge in me to find a guru or to share/group study with few others. Though none of us know Sanskrit as a spoken language,
					we read the script as we have all learnt Hindi. We try to decipher the meanings of each word or group of words with the help of Sanskrit 
					dictionary, guessing meanings from the English synopsis etc… but are struggling.<br><br>
					I happened to just now, stumble on to your site and lo ! I feel blessed.  The lucid way in which you have given the meanings of words/group
					of words makes is sooooo very simple.  My heartfelt thanks to you & your Guru who has taught you so well!
					I will religiously follow meanings from the first chapter and progress further. I eagerly await the addition of further dashakas.

					The website http://www.narayaneeyam-firststep.org/index.html dedicated to Narayaneeyam with meaning is really commendable.

					When we began the CompleteNarayaneeyam project, we too were keen to include the phrase-wise meanings, but due to insufficient knowledge of
					Sanskrit, we had to stay content with the brief meaning of the shlokams. <br><br>This work by Smt. Murarka to bring the detailed phrase-wise 
					meanings on the Internet is indeed praiseworthy. We wish her all success in completing all the 100 Dasakas at the earliest.

					Please accept my pranaams. IN the whole internet, I could find your material regarding Sri Naaraayaneeyam as the most convenient one. 
					<br>That is because the verses have been split grammatically for beginners such as me to recite with out any hastles.

					We, at IISc, are learning Narayaneeyam during our lunch hour and when we found your website with word to word meanings, we were very happy. 
					We have just started it, but we find it very good and helpful. Thanks a lot for such a great effort.
