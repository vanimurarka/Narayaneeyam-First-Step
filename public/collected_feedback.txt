Thanks a lot for the word split up for the entire shlokas of narayaneeyam . I was searching for this for the past 2 years and I found this website extremely useful . I have made two volumes of the entire narayaneeyam  with the word split up for easy reading . Once you go through it you will understand . If you want you can upload this in the website so that many people can get advantage of it . 
Once again I highly appreciate and thank you from the bottom of the heart for your splendid work .  </div><div id='feedback'>.<span id='name'>Name: Sharada Anand</span><span id='date'>Thursday 15th of February 2018</span><br><br>Namaste.

I find it very easy to learn and by heart. I have another humble request though. Please publish the magnum opus of Shri Vedanta Desika\'s work Sri Paadukaa Sahasram, composed on the greatness of the Holy feet of Sri Ranganatha Swami of Srirangam. My heart felt thanks in advance. Please find the original text at http://www.prapatti.com/slokas/sanskrit/paadukaasahasram/paadukaasahasram.pdf
