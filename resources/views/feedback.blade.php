	My wife and I really like your Narayaneeyam-firststep website. I took all the pdf documents from your website and combined into a single pdf file with links for easy navigation. It can easily load into a ipad or tablet and can be used in a disconnected mode. I wanted you to have it so you can distribute to more devotees.<br/>
	 <br/>
	By the way Shobha, my wife, has been chanting Narayaneeyam from a very early age and has been teaching for several years in Atlanta, GA, USA where we have settled since 1990. <br/>
	 <br/>
	Once again we thank you for all your effort. You have created a real nice document.<br/>

	Dear Asha,<br/>
	<br/>
	I was waiting for this moment for many years. It is was one of my dreams to study Narayaneeyam in Sanskrit.
	I have been a Sanskrit student for some time. So I bought the Narayaneeyam poem in the book form but each sloka had a prose explanation which did not help me.<br/>
	<br/>
	Your effort is marvellous, thank you. One can imagine the time and research you have invested to come up with
	this web site.<br/>
	<br/>
	However I have two suggestions. Most of the time you have given the meaning of a phrase. I prefer word by word so that I do not have to
	guess. As you can imagine, my proficiency in Sanskrit is that of a beginners. Secondly, I have a feeling that the explanations are in the
	British English. There are times when one cannot simplify further, but for students like me, Reader's Digest level is easy to comprehend.
	If there is a second edition, I hope, my suggestions may be considered.<br/>
	<br/>
	Thanks again for your super job.

	Namaste!  I would like to introduce about me first.  My name is Bhama.  In the year 2008 I learnt  Narayaneeyam slokas.  After completing the class I used to chant in my house daily with other prayer slokas.  I took sankalpam to read atleast one dasakam daily.  Till today I am following this sankalpam.  Now I could chant atleast ten dasakams daily.  In June 2013 I attended one Narayaneeyam sapthaha upanyasam. It was very very wonderful.   After this I thought if I get word by word meaning of Narayaneeyam, it will be very useful to me.  I don't know whether it is  coincidence or Lord Krishna has given reply to me through you.  I don't know how can I express my gratitude to you.    I saw the meanings of entire 1036 slokas of Narayaneeyam.  Vow! How much easy to do parayanam as well as to byheart the slokas.  Once again I thank you for this wonderful work you have done and I am very very grateful to you for ever.  I started chanting the same by understanding the meanings. I hope I could byheart the slokas and would like to start teaching to the  interested bhakthas as a service.

	Dear Sir<br/>
	<br/>
	I came across your wonderful site and have started reading the word by word meanings. It is a wonderful experience. <br/>
	<br/>
	I had the privilege of learning to chant this Epic (upto Sri Krishna Jananam) from Late Guruji Sri M R Venkateswaran. Thereafter, he was too feeble to teach our group. With the help of his CD, our small group learnt the chanting of the balance. <br/>
	<br/>
	I wish to clarify some doubts from you.<br/>
	<br/>
	In Dashakam 45, two slokas (11 and 12) are added while chanting which are probably not in the original Narayaneeyam. Can you please clarify how it was added and also give the meaning for the two slokas. I am attaching a word file with the slokas.<br/>
	<br/>
	Thanks in advance for your clarification.<br/>
	With regards<br/>
	<br/>

	I am a college student based in Baltimore, MD USA. I visited your website today and was amazed by the way the amount of information was presented. Reading shlokas and meanings from the website really gives easy access. Narayaneeyam is bhakthi filled in nature and your meanings and carefully selected words have given an ornamental make up to the shlokas.<br/>
	<br/>
	Thank you very much for the divine service. Hare Krishna!

	Please accept my pranaams. IN the whole internet, I could find your material regarding Sri Naaraayaneeyam as the most convenient one. 
	<br>That is because the verses have been split grammatically for beginners such as me to recite with out any hastles.

	My humble prostrations at the lotus feet of Lord Guruvayoorappan and sincere thanks to you for bringing out this site.
	I have just started ‘learning’ to read the great epic ‘Shriman Narayaneeyam’ as a group study along with a few like-minded friends.
	I have read the whole of Narayaneeyam  about 3 or 4 times on my own (once with English synopsis of each verse), but have not been satisfied.
	<br><br>
	This sparked an urge in me to find a guru or to share/group study with few others. Though none of us know Sanskrit as a spoken language,
	we read the script as we have all learnt Hindi. We try to decipher the meanings of each word or group of words with the help of Sanskrit 
	dictionary, guessing meanings from the English synopsis etc… but are struggling.<br><br>
	I happened to just now, stumble on to your site and lo ! I feel blessed.  The lucid way in which you have given the meanings of words/group
	of words makes is sooooo very simple.  My heartfelt thanks to you & your Guru who has taught you so well!
	I will religiously follow meanings from the first chapter and progress further. I eagerly await the addition of further dashakas.

	How can I explain the immense happiness I have now when I stumbled upon your wonderful site http://narayaneeyam-firststep.org/index.html.
	Today morning I was just thinking as to how to keep Narayaneeyam Parayanam for Dec 13 2009 on the Narayaneeyam day. While I have the gist of 
	meaning of every Narayaneeyam slokam already,  I was thinking how would it be if word-by-word translation is given on the web. <br><br>
	All these years
	I have browsed several days over the subject and such a thing never was available. Now when I came across your site it was like Lord 
	Guruvayurappan answering my thoughts. Hantha Bhaagyam Janaanaam! Thank you so much for your wonderful work and I eagerly look forward for 
	your uploading further Dasakams.

	When we began the CompleteNarayaneeyam project, we too were keen to include the phrase-wise meanings, but due to insufficient knowledge of
	Sanskrit, we had to stay content with the brief meaning of the shlokams. <br><br>This work by Smt. Murarka to bring the detailed phrase-wise 
	meanings on the Internet is indeed praiseworthy. We wish her all success in completing all the 100 Dasakas at the earliest.
